Build Electron Application with Vue.js and Typescript

We intend to simplify the boostrap of new `electron` application with `vue` and `typescript`. The framework is built arround the principle "conventions over configurations". 

The framework is perfect if you want to build your next application using modern tools without the hassle off dealing with ton's 

It is possible that our conventions to configure and bootstrap a new electron application not suit your needs. Feel free to request new `features` or `increases`

## Features

Bootstrap Electron Application in few lines with vuetronic.

### Typescript Support
Build your application with Typescript. Prevent errors and increase IDE integration with code completion.

### Standardized api's
Standardized api's to handle common uses cases such as upload a file, specify a folder to store data and more.

### Based on electron forge
Build on top of electron forge to package and distribute your application on Windows, MacOS and Linux.

### Powerfull Command Line Tool
Build your project during development, watch files with our Command Line Interface

### Integrated Devtools Support
Debug your application UI with Vue Devtools that are included during development stage without configuration needed.
